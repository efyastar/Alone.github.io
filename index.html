         In life
         <br>We sometimes go into something and it's totally different from what we expected it to be
         <br>At that moment in life, we feel like
         <br>Our time has been wasted
         <br>Our expectations have been crushed
         <br>It hurts the most when that road we 
         <br>decided to take pushed every other person away,<br> especially the ones that mattered the most to you
         <br>Sometimes when you come back
         <br>They we have no problem with it but intrinsically you feel 
         <br>Left out 
         <br><a href="yes 2.jpg">ALONE</a>
         <br>Not deserving of their love 
         <br>And it's like no matter how hard you try you can't seem to reconnect with them again
         <br>With all these feelings you will find a big gap which seem impossible to close no matter how hard you try 
         <br>The sad part of this is you will be the only one feeling it
         <br>On the out nothing seems wrong but on the inside<br>it's just <a href="YES 4.jpg">ALONE</a> your soul cries out
         <br>Because of this gap naturally you find things to fill
         <br>These whether it is good or bad you might not care 
         <br>All you know is that you want to fill it as soon as possible 
         <br>After 
         <br>You might feel 
         <br>Worse than before 
         <br>Better than before
         <br>I just don't care again
         <br><a href="YES 3.png">LONELINESS</a>if not cared for
         <br>Can lead to a much bigger problem than self destruction
